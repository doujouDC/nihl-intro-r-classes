# This is H1

This is my **first** *class* on `markdown`.

R is a programming language that is especially [powerful](https://www.nihlibrary.nih.gov/services/bioinformatics-support) for data exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that makes using R easier. In this course we use RStudio to interact with R. If you don't already have R and RStudio installed, follow the instructions for your operating system below. You have to install R before you install RStudio. Add a link to [Bioinformatics](https://www.nihlibrary.nih.gov/services/bioinformatics-support) support program (Figure 1).

#### This is H3

This is an example of an equation

$$
(6 + 5)^5/ (x^2)
$$

```{r}
(6 + 5)^5/ (10^2)
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
library(tidyverse)
mpg_doug <- mpg %>% 
  select(drv, cty)
```
