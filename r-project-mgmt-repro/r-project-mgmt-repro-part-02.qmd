# Configuration

This class features exercises that will help you learn by doing. To prepare, please install the following on your machine:

-   Install latest version of [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download), v2022.07.0-548 or later

-   Install latest version of [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) (v1.0.36 or greater)

Quarto is also available as a package. The **quarto** package provides an R interface to frequently used operations in the Quarto Command Line Interface (CLI). The package is not a requirement for using Quarto with R. Rather, it provides an R interface to common Quarto operations for users who prefer to work in the R console rather than a terminal, and for package authors that want to programatically interface with Quarto.

```{r}
# install.packages("quarto")
```

You will also need to install the [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) package. Knitr is a general-purpose tool for dynamic report generation in R using Literate Programming techniques.

```{r}
# install.packages("knitr")
```

Other useful packages to install include the tidyverse and rmarkdown packages.

[rmarkdown](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/rmarkdown/), The rmarkdown package helps you create dynamic analysis documents that combine code, rendered output (such as figures).

[tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/), includes the packages that you're likely to use in everyday data analyses.

# Introduction

This one-hour class focuses on data and project management using R and RStudio. RStudio makes it possible to work on a complete research project in a more efficient, integrated, and organized manner. Participants will learn how to create reproducible documents that combine code, analysis, and narrative. This intermediate-level course is designed to be relevant to students from different disciplines. Some familiarity or experience in R and RStudio is recommended but not required. Students are encouraged to install [R](https://mirrors.nics.utk.edu/cran/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) before the webinar so that they can follow along with the instructor.

Upon completion of this class students should be able to:

-   Create a markdown document using Quarto
-   Distinguish between source and visual editors
-   Add code chunks to markdown documents
-   Create a bibliography and link it to a markdown document

# Markdown and Literate Programming

Researchers and analysts tend to write a lot of reports, describing their analyses and results, for their collaborators or to document their work for future reference.

Ideally, you want your reports to be reproducible documents. For example, if an error is discovered, or if some additional subjects are added to the data, you can just re-compile the report and get the new or corrected results rather than having to reconstruct figures, paste them into a Word document, and hand-edit various detailed results.

Many new users begin by first writing a single R script containing all of their work, and then share the analysis by emailing the script and various graphs as attachments. But this can be cumbersome, requiring a lengthy discussion to explain which attachment was which result.

One option is using [R Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), a light-weight markup language for creating documents in multiple formats. When the document is processed by `knitr`, chunks of code will be executed, and graphs or other results will be inserted into the final document. This sort of idea has been called "literate programming".

Additionally, the formatting of and markdown document is simple and easy to modify, allowing you to spend more time on your analyses instead of writing reports. You can use a single markdown file to both

-   Save and execute code

-   Generate high quality reports that can be shared with an audience

This [page](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) provides a nice overview of R markdown the top provide examples of R Markdown documents, as well as an in depth discussion of various R Markdown topics.

# Quarto

In August 2022, RStudio adopted [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) as its supporting publishing platform. Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/). Quarto allows you to create dynamic content with [Python](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/python.html), [R](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/r.html), [Julia](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/julia.html), and [Observable](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/ojs.html).

-   Author documents as plain text markdown or [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks.

-   Publish high-quality articles, reports, presentations, websites, blogs, and books in multiple formats.

-   Author with scientific markdown, including equations, citations, crossrefs, and figure panels.

Figure 2 is displaying the workflow for Quarto.

![](images/quarto-workflow-example.png)

Figure 2: Quarto transformation workflow.

## How Quarto is Different From R Markdown

-   Quarto is compute-agnostic. R Markdown requires R.

-   The ecosystem of R packages is replaced by a single framework.

## R Markdown Only Options

-   Access tools built around R Markdown (e.g. `blogdown`) that haven't yet been implemented in Quarto

-   Heavy users of such tools may want to stick with R Markdown

## Quarto Only Options

-   Easier to organize appearance across documents

-   Features (e.g. figures, tables) have better cross-format support

-   Better cross referencing

-   Up-to-date revealjs slides. reveal.js is an open source HTML presentation framework. It's a tool that enables anyone with a web browser to create fully-featured and beautiful presentations for free.

-   Easier to customize websites and books with projects

## Quarto Interfaces

In this class we will be creating and interacting with Quarto docs using RStudio \[Figure 3\].

![](images/rstudio-preview.png)

Figure 3: Quarto doc opened in RStudio.

However, you can create Quarto docs using Jupyter notebooks \[Figure 4\].

![](images/jupyterlab-preview.png)

Figure 4: Quarto doc opened in a Jupyter notebook.

You can also create Quarto docs using a text editor. Figure 5 is a Quarto doc opened in Visual Studio Code editor. You might have also noticed that the code in Figure 5 is Python.

# Creating Quarto Documents

https://rstudio-conf-2022.github.io/rmd-to-quarto/materials/2-polishing-documents/

Quarto is a multi-language, next generation version of R Markdown from RStudio, with many new new features and capabilities. A Quarto document (`.qmd)` is a plain text file, that can be rendered to many different formats. Like R Markdown, Quarto uses [Knitr](https://yihui.org/knitr/) to execute R code, and is therefore able to render most existing Rmd files without modification. Also, most `.ipynb` can be rendered as-is via Quarto.

In this section we are going to learn how to create generic block and inline elements, set classes and attributes, and practice using Quarto-specific elements in RStudio's visual editor. Although we do not cover this topic in this class, I have included some resources on how to customize the appearance of your documents with elementary CSS.

https://quarto.org/docs/computations/r.html

Let us create a new document by navigating to `File > New File > Quarto Document` \[Figure 6\].

-   Add the title Proj-Mgmt-02.

-   Add your name as author

-   Leave Knitr as the render engine

-   Enable the Visual Markdown Editor (more about this feature below)

![](images/quarto-create-html.png)

Figure 6: Creating a new Quarto document.

If you scroll down the doc that you just created you can see that the Quarto file is already populated with text and code \[Figure 7\].

![](images/quarto-doc-source-view.png)

Figure 7: Default RMD document.

Let's first delete the generic text because we don't need it at this point. The only thing we need to keep is the Header:

`---`

`title: "Proj-Mgmt-01"`

`author: "Doug Joubert"`

`format: html`

`editor: visual`

`---`

## Quarto Content Structure

A Quarto document consists of content, structure, appearance, format \[Figure 8\].

+--------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| ![](images/quarto-rubiks-patent.png) | -   **Content:** text, code, graphics                |
|                                      |                                                      |
|                                      | -   **Structure:** paragraphs, lists, emphasis, etc. |
|                                      |                                                      |
|                                      | -   **Appearance**: fonts, colors, layout            |
|                                      |                                                      |
|                                      | -   **Format**: based on function                    |
+--------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+

Figure 8: Sample quarto document.

## What Define the Structure of a Document

A document is a list of **block elements** that contain **inline elements** or other blocks, along with associated **metadata**.

### Block Element

A Block Element starts on a new line and followed by an empty line. An example of block elements is included in Figure 9.

![](images/quarto-block-elements.png)

Figure 9: Example of Quarto block elements.

### Inline Element

Inline elements modify content inline and are not followed by a new line. An example of inline elements are included in Figure 10.

![](images/quarto-inline-element.png)

Figure 10: Inline element in a Quarto doc.

### Metadata Element

Metadata elements contain ancillary info about the document's origin, format, look, etc. An example of a metadata elements are included in Figure 11.

![](images/quarto-metadata.png)

Figure 11: Example of Quarto metadata elements.

Figure 12 is displaying both the Quarto code (left) and the rendered Quarto code (right).

|-------------------------|---------------------------|

Figure 12: Example of a rendered Quarto document.

## Editor Options

### Visual Editor

The Quarto visual editor provides a [WYSIWYM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYM) editing interface for all of Pandoc markdown, including tables, citations, cross-references, footnotes, divs/spans, definition lists, attributes, raw HTML/TeX, and more. The visual editor also includes support for executing code cells and viewing their output inline.

Current version of RStudio has the Source/Visual tabs on the Menu panel. If you are using an older version of RStudio, the visual editor is accessible through a small button on the far right side of the script/document pane in RStudio. The icon is a protractor, but from further away it just looks like a squiggly "A". Figure 13 is displaying the Quarto document for this class, in visual mode.

![](images/quarto-visual-editor-display.png)

Figure 13: Markdown using the visual editor.

### Source Editor

Figure 14 is showng the same document using the "source editor" mode. Notice the symbols scattered throughout the text are examples of R Markdown syntax.

![](images/quarto-source-editor-display.png)

Figure 14: RMD file using Source Editor.

It is good to be aware of how to use the source editor, since you might have to fix a piece of broken markdown created using the Visual Editor.

# Basic Markdown

Markdown is designed to be easy to write, and, even more importantly, easy to read. As previously mentioned, Quarto uses extended version of [**Pandoc markdown**](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown) designed with multiple output formats in mind.

## Block Elements

### Block Elements: Lists

You can make a numbered list by just using numbers.

    1. bold with double-asterisks
    2. italics with underscores
    3. code-type font with backticks

This will appear as:

1.  bold with double-asterisks

2.  italics with underscores

3.  code-type font with backticks

Pandoc gives you a lot of control over lists, including *nesting*, *definition lists*, *blocks in lists*, and *example lists*. The Pandoc [manual](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#lists) has detailed information about lists.

### Block Elements: Headers

You can make section headers of different sizes by initiating a line with some number of `#` symbols:

    # Title
    ## Main section
    ### Sub-section
    #### Sub-sub section

### Block Elements: Math

When using math as Block Elements, math use `$$` delimiters. The delimiters may be separated from the formula by whitespace. No blank lines between the opening and closing `$$` delimiters. For example:

A larger equation:

$$ 
f(x)={\sqrt{\frac{\tau}{2\pi}}}
      e^{-\tau (x-\mu )^{2}/2}
$$

### Block Elements: Images

Block images use the same syntax as inline images. However, images on their own line become a block:

Images on their own line become a block:

![Elephant](images/elephant.png){width="220"}

## Inline Elements

### Inline Elements: Text Formatting {#inline-elements-text-formatting}

You make things **bold** using two asterisks, like this: `**bold**`, and you make things *italics* by using underscores, like this: `_italics_`.

You can make a bullet list by writing a list with hyphens or asterisks, like this:

    * bold with double-asterisks
    * italics with underscores
    * code-type font with backticks

or like this:

    - bold with double-asterisks
    - italics with underscores
    - code-type font with backticks

Each will appear as:

-   bold with double-asterisks

-   italics with underscores

-   code-type font with backticks

You can use whatever method you prefer, but *be consistent*. This maintains the readability of your code.

### Inline Elements: Math

Figure 15 is displaying the markdown that generates the math displayed below.

![](images/inline-element-math.png)

Figure 15: Inline element: math markdown.

The area of a circle is $A = pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius and $pi$ is the constant $3.141592\ldots$.

TeX math occurs between two `$`. Opening `$` must have a non-space character immediately to its right, while the closing `$` must have a non-space character immediately to its left, and must not be followed immediately by a digit.

### Inline Elements: Links and Images

You can embed links with names [Links in Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/html.html#links)

You can also used direct links <https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/html.html#links>

Linking to images is very similar, except that you start with a bang `!` This is an example of and inline link to an image of an Elephant ![This is a white elephant](images/elephant.png)

The text withing the `[]` provides a caption for the embedded image.

## Metadata: YAML

Metadata can be included via YAML, which is human-readable data-serialization language. It is commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted. For example the Header of a Quarto document:

``` yaml
---
title: "US Patent: A Spatial Toy"
author: 
  - Erno Rubrik
  - Albert Einstein
format: 
  html:
    toc: true
    abstract: |
      This is the abstract.
    
      It has two paragraphs.
---
```

There are some syntax rules:

-   Set a single option `key: value`

-   Strings with `:` must be quoted

-   Include multiple values in a list with `-`

-   Nest key-value pairs using indentation

-   Multi-line strings follow `|`

-   Multiple YAML blocks in a document will be merged

These two resources have more information about YAML

2.  An overview of [YAML syntax:](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML#Syntax)

# Adding Code Blocks Using R

Quarto is a multi-language, next generation version of R Markdown from RStudio, with many new new features and capabilities. Like R Markdown, Quarto uses [Knitr](https://yihui.org/knitr/) to execute R code, and is therefore able to render most existing Rmd files without modification.

This section will only focus on code blocks [using R](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/r.html). Quarto [documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) includes options for other languages. We'll start by covering the basics of Quarto, then delve into the differences between Quarto and R Markdown in the sections on [Chunk Options](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/r.html#chunk-options) and [Output Formats](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/r.html#output-formats) below. Let us revisit the Quarto workflow that we saw in Figure 2, focusing on the code block \[Figure 17\].

![](images/quarto-workflow-example-code.jpg)

Figure 17: Quarto workflow, with focus on code blocks and conversion of code.

## Inserting Code Chunks

You can quickly insert chunks like these into your file with:

-   the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Alt + I (OS X: Cmd + Option + I)

-   the Add Chunk command in the editor toolbar

-   or by typing the chunk delimiters {r} and \`\`\`.

The most basic (and empty) code chunk looks like this \[Figure 18\]

![](images/blank-code-chunk.png){width="6.5in"}

Figure 18: Code chunk in Source-mode and in Visual-mode.

Although I am demonstrating using R, it's possible to use other programming or markup languages. For example, we have seen that we can use LaTeX code for equations. You can also use python and a handful of other languages \[Figure 19\].

![](images/code-chunk-other.png){width="6.5in"}

Figure 19: Code options available in markdown.

## Basic Anatomy of the Code Chunk

Code blocks that use braces around the language name (e.g. `{r}`) are executable, and will be run by Quarto during render. Here is a simple example:

```{r Creating Air Quality Figure Version 1}
#| label: fig-airquality 01
#| fig-cap: Temperature and ozone level.

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess"
)
```

You might have noticed that there are some special comments at the top of the code block. These comments use `#| (the hash pipe!)`. `#|` provides the cell options. When the document is rendered, this code chunk will look like this \[Figure 20\]:

![](images/quarto-code-chunk-rendered.png)

Figure 20: Rendered version of a code-chunk.

## Run the code in a code chunk

There are 3 main options for running and debugging code that don't require us to wait for the file to render.

1)  Run from code chunk (green play button on the right top corner). This allows us to run one specific code chunk \[Figure 21\].

![](images/code-chunk-run-01.png){width="6.5in"}

Figure 21: Running a code chunk from the code-box.

2.  Run menu, which gives more options for running code chunks including the current one, the next one, all chunks, etc \[Figure 22\].

![](images/code-run-chunk-02.png){width="6.5in"}

+----------------------------+---------------------+---------------------+
| Go to previous chunk/title | Ctrl+PgUp           | Command+PgUp        |
+----------------------------+---------------------+---------------------+

## Labeling Code Chunk

While not necessary for running your code, it is good practice is to give a name to each code chunk because it gives the chunk a unique identifier which allows for more advanced options (such as cross-referencing) to work with your rmd files later on:

`{r chunk-name}`

Some things to keep in mind

-   The chunk name is the only value other than r in the code chunk options that doesn't require a tag (i.e. `echo =` )

-   The chunk label has to be unique (i.e. you can't use the the same name for multiple chunks)

We'll see in a bit where this code chunk label comes in handy. But, for now let's go back and give our first code chunk a name:

1.  Creating Air Quality Figure

2.  Then, run the code-chunk

```{r Creating Air Quality Figure Version 2}
#| label: fig-airquality 02
#| fig-cap: Temperature and ozone level.

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess")
```

Figure 23 is displaying the output of the code-chunk. Can you explain what is happening in the console?

![](images/knit-02.png){width="6.5in"}

Figure 23: Output from our first code chunk.

## Code Chunk Options

There are over 50 different code chunk options. Wow, that is a lot. Obviously we will not go over all of them, but they fall into several larger categories including: code evaluation, text output, code style, cache options, plot output and animation.

You can find a complete list of code chunk options on Knitr developer, Yihui Xie's, [online guide to knitr](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/). Or, you can find a brief list of all options on the R Markdown Reference guide on page 3 accesible through the RStudio Interface by navigating to the main menu bar `Help > Cheat Sheets > R Markdown Reference Guide`.

The chunk name is the only value other than `r` in the code chunk options that doesn't require a tag (i.e. the "= VALUE" part of `option = VALUE`). So chunk options will always require a tag, and the syntax will be in the form:

`{r chunk-label, option = VALUE}`

The option always follows the code chunk label (don't forget to add a `,` after the label either).

## Code Evaluation Option

+------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Option** | **Description**                                                                                                                              |
+:===========+:=============================================================================================================================================+
| `include`  | Catch all for preventing any output (code or results) from being included (e.g. `include: false` suppresses all output from the code block). |
+------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

## Text Output Options

+------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Option** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                   |
+:===========+:==================================================================================================================================================================================================+

| `echo`     | Include the source code in output                                                                                                                                                                 |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| `output`   | Include the results of executing the code in the output (`true`, `false`, or `asis` to indicate that the output is raw markdown and should not have any of Quarto's standard enclosing markdown). |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| `warning`  | Include warnings in the output.                                                                                                                                                                   |

The code chunk below is a modification of the previous code chunk and includes the text output option `warning: false`

```{r Creating Air Quality Figure Version 3}
#| label: fig-airquality 03
#| fig-cap: Temperature and ozone level.
#| warning: false

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess"
)
```

The `knitr` syntax for passing options still works since Quarto uses `knitr`.

```{r Creating Air Quality Figure Version 3, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") +
  labs(caption = "Temperature and ozone level")
  
```

While it is possible to use R chunks options, hash pipe options are more portable across computational engines. Also, don't forget the "tab-complete" option that is built into RStudio \[Figure 24\].

![](images/code-yaml-auto-complete.png)

Figure 24: Example of tab-complete feature in RStudio.

# Figure Output

Figure output options are similar to those used in R markdown. However, Pandoc markdown syntax is used for figures. Let us compare the two options. The code chunk below is using R markdown.

```{r Penguins Version 1}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm,
                     y = bill_depth_mm,
                     col = island)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(caption ="Penguin lenght and depth",
       alt="Penguin data from palmerpenguins package")
```

The code chunk below is using Pandoc/Quarto

```{r Penguins Version 2}
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-height: 3
#| fig-cap: "Penguin lenght and depth"
#| fig-alt: "Penguin data from palmerpenguins package"


library(palmerpenguins)
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm,
                     y = bill_depth_mm,
                     col = island)) +
  geom_point() 
```

# Rendering

There are three methods for rendering a Quarto document.

1.  Render in RStudio

2.  System shell via `quarto render`

3.  R console via `quarto` R package

## Rendering in RStudio Via Knitr

RStudio has deep integration with R, `knitr` and Quarto

-   Render button

-   Visual Editor

-   Preview of output

You should always use the most recent release of the RStudio IDE - especially for the Quarto features. RStudio `2022.07` and beyond comes bundled with a production-stable release of Quarto, no additional installs are needed.

When you Render in RStudio, starts a background job and previews the output. Quarto uses the [Knitr](https://yihui.org/knitr/) engine just like RMarkdown to execute R code natively. Quarto can *also* use the Jupyter engine to natively execute Julia, Python, or other languages that Jupyter supports.

Figure 25 is highlighting the **Render** button to preview documents as you edit them.

![](images/quarto-rstudio-render.png)

Figure 25: Rendering Quarto documents in RStudio.

## System shell via `quarto render`

### Navigating in the terminal

Because Quarto is also a command line interface (CLI), there are times you'll need to use it via the terminal. The table below provides some common commands.

+------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| **Command**                        | **Action**                                            |
+:===================================+:======================================================+
| `pwd`                              | Print name of current working directory               |
+------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| `cd`                               | Change current working directory                      |
+------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| `ls`                               | List directory contents                               |
+------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| `quarto --help`                    | Return `quarto` help docs                             |
+------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| `mkdir howdy`                      | Make a new folder/directory called "howdy"            |
+------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| `rm howdy/some-file.qmd` \| Remove | a file called `some-file.qmd` from the "howdy" folder |
+------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+

A great overview of using the command line and navigating files/directories is available via the [Data Carpentries](https://datacarpentry.org/shell-genomics/02-the-filesystem/index.html) or a great interactive tool for understanding commands: [https://tldr.ostera.io](https://tldr.ostera.io/).

## R console via `quarto` R package

If you are not using RStudio and/or you prefer to render from the R console, you can do so using the **quarto** R package. To install the R package

```{r install Quarto package}
# install.packages("quarto")
```

I have commented out the code since I already have the package installed. You can learn more about the package from the Quarto resources [page](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/), or from the GitHub page.

# Bibliography, Citations & Cross-Referencing

Quarto will use Pandoc to automatically generate citations and a bibliography in a number of styles. To use this capability, you will need:

-   A quarto document formatted with citations (see [Citation Markdown](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html#sec-citations)).

-   A bibliographic data source, for example a BibTeX (`.bib`) file.

-   Optionally, a `CSL` file which specifies the formatting to use when generating the citations and bibliography.

## Bibliography Files

Quarto supports bibliography files in a wide variety of formats including BibTeX and CSL. Add a bibliography to your document using the `bibliography` YAML metadata field. You must link the bib file and any associated output styles in the Header of your RMD file. For example

    ---
    title: "Introduction to Project Management (Part 2)"
    bibliography: nihl-r-classes.bib
    ---

## Citation Syntax

Quarto uses the standard Pandoc markdown representation for citations (e.g. `[@citation]`) --- citations go inside square brackets and are separated by semicolons. Since I will copying my references from Endnote, I will not go over the citation metadata. You can provide citation data for Quarto documents in the document front matter. The citation options are based upon the [Citation Style Language (CSL) specification for items](https://docs.citationstyles.org/en/stable/specification.html), but as YAML (rather than XML). Consult this [page](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/metadata/citation.html) for more information.

## Citation Style

Quarto uses Pandoc to format citations and bibliographies. By default, Pandoc will use the [Chicago Manual of Style](https://chicagomanualofstyle.org/) author-date format, but you can specify a custom formatting using CSL ([Citation Style Language](https://citationstyles.org/)). To provide a custom citation stylesheet, provide a path to a CSL file using the `csl` metadata field in your document, for example:

    ---
    title: "My Document"
    bibliography: references.bib
    csl: nature.csl
    ---

You can find CSL files or learn more about using styles at the [CSL Project](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles). You can browse the list of more than 8,500 Creative Commons CSL definitions in the CSL Project's [central repository](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles) or Zotero's [style repository](https://www.zotero.org/styles).

## Creating Your Reference List

You need to have a list of references saved to a bib file before you can insert citations into your markdown document. A file with the BIB file extension is a BibTeX Bibliographical Database file. It's a specially formatted text file that lists references pertaining to a particular source of information. Each item can be edited, in case there is any metadata incorrect or missing.

There are a number of ways to create your bib file.

1.  Manually
2.  Use a citation tool like Endnote or Zotero
3.  Use the lookup feature to search for publications by DOI (Digital Object Identifier), Crossref, DataCite, or PubMed ID

Most citation and reference management tools such as Refworks, Endnote, Mendeley and Zotero, as well as some most scientific databases allow you to export citations as .bib [BibteX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX) files.

I am going to show you how to export references from Endnote to your bib file. Figure 26 is displaying all of the references in my Endnote Library. I have highlighted the DataServices folder since I only want to explore these 742 records.

![](images/bib-01.png)

Figure 26: Example of an Endnote Library.

The first thing I need to do is to get the records in the correct format (bibtex). The Output Style Manager is locating under the Tools Menu (I am on Mac OS) \[Figure 27\].

![](images/bib-02.png){width="624"}

Figure 27: Selecting the bibtext output format in Endnote.

If *bibtext* format is not in the list of styles, you can use **Open Style Manager** to search for the *bibtex* format.

The next step is to select all of the references that you want in your bib file and choose the **Copy Formatted Reference** option \[Figure 28\]. Please note that using **Copy** will not work.

![](images/bib-03.png){width="642"}

Figure 28: Copying references from an Endnote Library in *bibtext* format.

Figure 29 is showing single reference in *bibtext* format. As you can see in Figure 29, the *bibtext* format is a tagged format that starts with the reference type, preceded by the \@ symbol. In this particular example, the reference type is [inbook](https://www.bibtex.com/t/template-inbook/).

![](images/bib-04.png)

Figure 29: Example of a record in bibtext format.

The minimal template for a chapter or section in a book with authors is included below.

    @inbook{citekey,
      author    = "",
      title     = "",
      chapter   = "",
      publisher = "",
      year      = ""
    }

The BibTeX [website](http://www.bibtex.org/Format/) is a great resources for learning more about formatting options. Overleaf is another great [resource](Bibliography%20management%20with%20bibtex) with a focus on bibliographic management.

## Exporting Your Reference List from Endnote

There are two ways to export the selected references from Endnote:

1.  Copy and past into a text document
2.  Using the Export feature in Endnote

I will cover using the Export feature from Endnote. These steps are very similar in Zotero, Refworks or Mendeley \[Figure 30\]:

1.  Make sure you have selected your records
2.  Choose File-\>Export in Endnote
3.  Make sure the Output Style says BibTeX
4.  Make sure the file extension is bib
5.  Make sure you are saving the file in the same folder as your RMD file.
6.  Click Save
7.  Make sure the file was saved to the correct directory. Note, that you might have to manually check the file extensions after you export it.

![](images/bib-05.png)

Figure 30: Using the Export feature in Endnote.

In some cases you might need to manually change the file extension from .txt to .bib \[Figure 31\].

![](images/bibtext-file-name.png)

Figure 31: Manually changing the file extension for a .bib file.

## Inserting Citations

Choose Insert\>Citation within RStudio \[Figure23\].

![](images/bib-07.png)

Figure 23: Inserting a citation in RStudio in Visual Mode.

When you do this, you should see the records in the linked bib file. The search box in Figure 23 is a free text search. This means that it will search on the Author names and the title. Thus, if I search for the name **Healy**, the reference list will filter to contain records that match my search string \[Figure 24\] .

![](images/bib-08.png)

Figure 24: Searching for a record in your bib file.

The record number should appear at the insertion point in your RMD file \[Figure 25\].

![](images/bib-09.png)

Figure 25: Reference inserted into a RMD document.

## Changing Citation Styles

By default, RStudio via Pandoc will use a Chicago author-date format for citations and references. To use another style, you will need to specify a CSL (Citation Style Language) file in the csl metadata field in the YAML.

You can find CSL formats on the [Zotero Style Repository](https://www.zotero.org/styles), which makes it easy to search for and download your desired style.

Download the format you wish to use and call it out in the YAML. I have already saved the APA CSL file in the project folder. But if you would like to follow the process or try another style, go to the Zotero Style repo and select [American Psychological Association 7th edition](https://www.zotero.org/styles/apa) or any other style of your choice. You will notice that it will automatically download the file (e.g. `apa.csl`).

Make sure to save it to your project directory in report/source folder. In the YAML we have to call the exact name of the file preceded by "csl:" The Header of your RMD file should now look like this \[Figure 26\]:

![](images/bib-10.png)

Figure 26: RMD Header with a linked bib file and output style.

## Bibliography Generation

Pandoc will automatically generate a list of works cited and place it in the document if the style calls for it. It will be placed in a div with the id `refs` if one exists:

    ### References

    ::: {#refs}
    :::

If no such div is found, the works cited list will be placed at the end of the document.

The bibliography will be formatted when you Render your file \[Figure 27\]. In Figure 27. I have knitted the RMD document in html format.

![](images/bib-11.png)

Figure 27: Knitted document with formatted bibliography.

**Tip**

You can suppress generation of a bibliography by including `suppress-bibliography: true` option in your document metadata.
