# Introduction to Version Control and GitHub (New)

## Description

This class provides an introduction to version control and using [GitHub](https://github.com/) for project versioning. Students will have a better understanding of version control and its advantages for collaboration and version control.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this class students should be able to:

-   Recognize why version control is useful
-   Discuss the difference between Git and GitHub
-   List the options for authenticating to GitHub
-   Create a personal access token (PAT)

## Assumptions for This Class

This class makes a few assumptions about your understanding of R and RStudio:

1.  You have already installed [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/#Desktop).
2.  You have experience with R. If not, here are some resources for getting started:

-   NIH Library [Introduction to R and RStudio](https://www.nihlibrary.nih.gov/training/introduction-r-and-rstudio-9) class
-   [A (very) short introduction to R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Torfs+Brauer-Short-R-Intro.pdf)
-   [Quick-R](http://www.statmethods.net/)
-   [Getting up to speed with R](https://rkabacoff.github.io/datavis/Rintro.pdf)

3.  You have already created a GitHub account

# Data Visualization in ggplot: Visualizing Relationships and Linear Regression

## Description

This class provides a basic overview of the methods used to visualize the association among two or more quantitative variables. This class will focus on scatterplots, scatterplot matrix, and visualizing paired data. Participants are expected to have taken the [Introduction to Data Visualization in R: ggplot](https://www.nihlibrary.nih.gov/training/introduction-data-visualization-r-ggplot-8) class. Participants must also install [R](https://mirrors.nics.utk.edu/cran/), [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), and the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) package, before the class so that they can follow along with the instructor.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this class, students should be able to:

-   

-   Define bivariate data

-   

-   Define scatterplot

-   

-   Create a scatterplot using ggplot

-   

-   Define linear regression

-   

-   Demonstrate how to perform a simple linear regression in R

-
