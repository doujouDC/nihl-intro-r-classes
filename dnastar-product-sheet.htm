    is a suite of tools that contains the following workflows, which can be
accessed via the DNAStar Navigator:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Molecular biology</li>
  <li>Genomics</li>
  <li>Transcriptomics:</li>
  <li>Protein analysis ad modeling</li>
</ul>
  <p>Detailed Information about each workflow is included in a separate handout.</p>
  <h1>How to Access</h1>
  <p>The NIH Library licenses are available to all NIH researchers, that don’t have access through their IC or lab. If you are part of NCI, please contact the <a
